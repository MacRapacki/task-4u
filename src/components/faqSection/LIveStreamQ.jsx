            1. First of all, if you would like to use AutoDJ and broadcast live
            using Mixxx, you need to create at least one DJ account in Centova
            Cast Control Panel by selecting the DJ option in the menu of Centova
            Cast Control Panel.{"\n"} Restart the server after adding each DJ
            account. Only one DJ can be connected to the server at the time. If
            you do not use the AutoDJ feature or have a server without AutoDJ,
            you can skip this first step.

            7. Select the bitrate (audio quality) of the stream. If you use
            AutoDJ the bitrate of your live stream should be the same as the
            bitrate of your server/AutoDJ. If you do not use AutoDJ make sure
            that broadcasting bitrate does not exceed the maximum bitrate of
            your server. You can check the maximum broadcasting bitrate of your
            server in the Quick links section of your Centova Cast Control
            Panel.{"\n"} Select the audio coded for your stream. We recommend
            broadcasting in MP3 file format because it is supported by most of
            the players on the Intenet.
